# Comments-Section

<p>Deployed: https://or21321.github.io/Comments-Section-Angular/</p>

<p>Comments-Section is a comments application, which allows the user to select a user to login to from the users list, and then add a new comment / reply to an existing comment.</p>

<p>The comments are sorted by their creation time.</p>
<p>Each user can edit his own comments. Comment creation preperty is updated when edited.</p>
<p>User can delete his own comments, deleting also the comment's replies, with a delete confirm popup.</p>
<p>Responsive designed, abit more styling needed but 90% is done.</p>
<p>Comment's createdAt property is formatted and presented to the user using a custom pipe made by me.</p>
<p>The data is read from a json file once when app loads, the saved to localStorage (survives through reloads of the page).</p>

<p>Built using Angular / Typescript / rxjs.</p>

<p>Had lots of fun building this app, thank you Oren! :))</p>
